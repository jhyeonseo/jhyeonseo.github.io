I am a Ph.D. student at Yonsei University [Machine Learning Lab](https://ml.yonsei.ac.kr/), advised by [Kibok Lee](https://sites.google.com/site/kibok90).  
My research interests lie in machine learning and computer vision, with primary focus on **open-world learning** based on **continual lifelong learning and few-shot learning**. 
Recently, I am interested in exploring this topic further with multi-modal data.
